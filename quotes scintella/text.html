                    <p style="text-align: justify;" style="padding: 5px; margin: 20px;">Where globalization emblematizes
                        web or a chain, the underprivileged people are somewhere entangled and drowned without prophets
                        in broader proportions.
                        When a local entrepreneur produces something tagged "swadeshi", his products are denied because
                        the shrewd and cunning international entrepreneur who sell it in a cheaper rate because they
                        have much advanced and cheap technologies. In India, where not all citizens are that advanced in
                        using internet and are unaware of the gigantic benifits of this global web and worthwhile
                        advancements in technologies, the privileged ones fool and use them. Ordinary people are
                        becoming parasites!! Those lazy being who are not even able to be productive in their own
                        skins(country) nor cherishing their own cultures. <br>
                        In terms of economy, our Money, the money our parents, our nation as a whole is earning, rich
                        and thick flows to other parts of globe with leaving our underprivileged friends in
                        perplexity.(148) The world is ruled by superior businessmen, who in greed for money and fame are
                        breaking the interlinked chains that the common businessman have set up by burning the midnight
                        oil. In a flash of seconds, thousands of workes become unemployed or either less paid because
                        their work is reduced. For example a grocery store needs a location, workes and other necessary
                        equipments, but the clever entrepreneur do it without a location (most importantly) and delivery
                        boys only.
                        So as a summary, underprivileged people with less money and rights are not as benefited as the
                        privileged ones.
